1. About MBE
-------------
MBE is a Print Circuit Board editor software.
It needs .NET Framework 2.0 or later and it works on 
Windows XP/Vista/7/8.x/10.

You can design PCB of the following specifications.
  *Up to 300mm square.
  *1/2/4 copper layers.

***** WARNING *****
Cost is needed for ordering a PCB.
Even if you get an unexpected PCB, I do not assume any responsibility.
I recommend you to verify the CAM data before ordering the PCB. 
There are excellent free gerber viewes in Internet.
*******************

This package is an archive of a solution folder created with
Visual Studio 2008 C#.

Though I use Visual Stusio 2008 Standard Edition, 
You can also build MBE with Visual C# 2008 Express Edition
